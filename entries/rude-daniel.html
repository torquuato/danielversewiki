                        <p><i>"my favourite character is elon musk from hazbin hotel" - Rude Daniel</i></p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Rude Daniel</strong> (not to be confused with the entirely separate entity <a
                            href="">Roudaniel</a>) emerged into existence on 24/10/2025 under circumstances that
                        multiversal analysts frequently describe as “deeply preventable.” His creation is widely
                        attributed to the moment when <strong>Daniel (Prime)</strong> came into contact with legally
                        obtained and responsibly consumed alcohol, an event that caused a subtle but measurable fracture
                        in the timeline. This fracture, according to temporal-behavioral studies, resulted not in the
                        extraction or purification of Daniel (Prime)’s negative or impolite traits, but in their
                        inadvertent duplication, thereby producing a distinct entity whose entire personality
                        architecture is structured around the amplified expression of Daniel (Prime)’s rudest
                        tendencies. In contrast to theoretical frameworks such as the one showcased in Toxic Rick’s
                        origin, this process did not cleanse Daniel (Prime) of his undesirable traits; instead, it
                        simply replicated them with unnecessary enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>Rude Daniel’s full conceptual realization occurred shortly thereafter, during a documented visit
                        to the mystical and highly mythologized establishment known as <strong>Wetherspoons</strong>.
                        During this excursion, he purchased a beverage identified in multiple accounts as a “spicy mango
                        drink,” a concoction whose properties remain poorly understood but are consistently described as
                        both aggressively tangy and inexplicably catalytic. The consumption of this potion-like drink is
                        widely believed to have intensified the already unstable emotional energies within the newly
                        formed duplicate, producing a temperament that scholars frequently categorize as “fiery,”
                        “snappish,” and “exhaustively disdainful.”</p>
                    <p>This moment is considered by most canon historians to mark the point at which Rude Daniel
                        transitioned from a loosely formed conceptual echo into a fully realized and autonomous
                        Danielverse variant. Despite the origins of his personality being rooted in Daniel (Prime)’s
                        emotional spectrum, Rude Daniel exhibits a dramatic escalation in irritability, impatience, and
                        general abrasiveness, leading many analysts to classify him as one of the most behaviorally
                        volatile Daniel variants currently documented. His presence in the Danielverse continues to
                        challenge canonical assumptions about emotional duplication, timeline integrity, and the ethical
                        ramifications of beverage-fueled multiversal accidents.</p>

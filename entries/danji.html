                    <div class="box">
                        <p><i>"woof!" *pukes and poops all over self* - Danji</i></p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Danji Cridlander</strong> (known on the streets as <strong>“The Yorksaw Man”</strong>,
                        <strong>“D. Slicer”</strong>, and in one police report simply <strong>“Why Is He Covered In
                            Chains?”</strong>) is a half-man, half-chainsaw disaster fueled by equal parts desperation,
                        debt, and a questionable diet of petrol-station pasties.</p>

                    <p>Born with nothing but a dream, a rusted starter cord lodged in his chest, and generational
                        council tax debt, Danji survived by hunting <strong>Yorkshire Devils</strong>—supernatural
                        entities ranging from towering fog wraiths to mildly aggressive geese that roam outside Greggs.
                        His only companion was his best friend and pet chainsaw spirit, <strong>Poch-Crid</strong>, who
                        spoke exclusively in riddles and threatening Yorkshire sayings like “Tha’s in for it now, lad.”
                    </p>

                    <p>Danji’s life changed forever when he encountered the enigmatic, terrifyingly calm <strong>Rakima
                            Preston</strong>—Director of the <strong>Y.H.D.C. (Yorkshire Hybrid Devil Control)</strong>.
                        Rakima offered him a choice: serve her agency or be “flattened into summat useful, like a
                        coaster.” Enchanted by her power, beauty, and ability to pronounce “West Riding” with
                        intimidating authority, Danji swore eternal loyalty.</p>

                    <p>Under Rakima's command, Danji unlocked new forms such as <strong>Chain-Overdrive Mode</strong>,
                        <strong>Full-Spin Frenzy</strong>, and the forbidden <strong>Crid-Saw Berserk State</strong>,
                        during which he can spin so fast he briefly becomes immune to bus fare. His missions became
                        legendary, including <strong>The Great Leeds Devil Riot</strong>, the <strong>Battle of
                            Meadowhall Car Park</strong>, and the time he accidentally chainsawed a hole through reality
                        and met five alternate versions of himself, all wearing the same knockoff Adidas hoodie.</p>

                    <p>Despite his immense power, Danji’s heart remains painfully simple. He dreams only of <strong>a
                            normal life</strong>: three meals a day, a warm bed, and for Rakima Preston to pat him on the
                        head just once without threatening to revoke his tea privileges. Sadly, Rakima sees him less as a
                        partner and more as a loyal weapon—a fact she reminds him of often with her signature phrase:
                        <strong>“Good lads obey.”</strong></p>

                    <p>Rumors say Danji’s potential is limitless. Some claim that if Rakima ever loosens his metaphorical
                        leash—or literal one—he could ascend into the mythical form known as <strong>Ultra
                            Danji</strong>, capable of slicing Yorkshire into two separate counties or, more
                        unbelievably, pronouncing “scone” in a way that satisfies everyone.</p>

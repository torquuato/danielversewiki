                        <p><i>"have a danieltastic day!" - Daniel (Prime)</i></p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>DANIEL Middlename Cridland</strong> (also known by <strong>“D. Criddy”</strong>,
                        <strong>“Cridders”</strong>, <strong>“The Manx Menace”</strong>, and, on precisely one abandoned
                        forum, <strong>“Emperor Cridlor the Unfathomable”</strong>) is the level <strong>500 Yakuza boss
                            right-hand man</strong> to the infamous <strong>Billius “Billy” Baker</strong>, to whom he
                        is Best Friends, Blood Brothers, and Co-Owners of a failing Etsy store.
                    </p>

                    <p>While he is most well known for creating the <strong>JHC (Judy Hopps Chronicles)</strong>—the
                        internet’s most disgusting, horrible webcomic, with a body count significantly higher than its
                        readership—Daniel’s creative crimes do not end there. As the visionary behind
                        <strong>Aphantasia</strong>, Steam’s hottest, freshest, youngest RPGMaker game (boasting *one*
                        playable sprite and *zero* textures), he further cemented himself as a menace to the arts. His
                        accolades include such record-breaking feats as <strong>“Most Babies Eaten In One
                            Sitting”</strong>, <strong>“Most Respectful Japanese Bows In One Hour”</strong>,
                        <strong>“Most Irish”</strong>, and the lesser-known but equally impressive <strong>“Longest Time
                            Maintaining Direct Eye Contact With A Seagull Before It Backed Down.”</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>However, Daniel’s ascent to infamy was not always guaranteed. He would lead a painfully ordinary
                        life until applying to <strong>UCM (University College Isle of Man)</strong>, where he
                        encountered his so-called <strong>“lesser friends.”</strong> Sensing opportunity—like a vulture
                        senses a carcass or a gamer senses unpaid DLC—he reinvented himself into a more maniacal, cold,
                        unfeeling, dominant force, vowing to shackle his newfound companions to a lifetime of
                        psychological torment for his amusement.</p>

                    <p>Over time, Daniel discovered their suffering to be a deep well of <strong>creative
                            inspiration</strong>. From their collective anguish emerged entire new worlds—dark,
                        sprawling universes full of tyrants, rabbits, and legally questionable culinary habits. His
                        friends’ misery served as both muse and fuel, allowing him to expand his existing works into a
                        multimedia empire stretching across webcomics, cursed wiki entries, and at least two Discord
                        servers that have been banned for <strong>“philosophical misconduct.”</strong></p>

                    <p>In the modern era of Criddy Lore, it is said Daniel spends his days alternating between creating
                        new mythologies, terrorizing group chats, bowing respectfully at pedestrians, and challenging
                        Manx wildlife to dominance standoffs. Legends claim that when the moon is full, he ascends
                        briefly to <strong>Level 501</strong>, unlocking the sacred technique known as <strong>Hyper
                            Crid Mode</strong>, during which he can produce an entire webcomic chapter in under four
                        minutes—none of which is readable.</p>

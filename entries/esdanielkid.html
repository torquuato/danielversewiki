                    <div class="box">
                        <p><i>"Young Scouse kid, make it sound like I'm from Hoppstown (Okay)" - EsDanielKid</i></p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>EsDanielKid</strong> is an English rapper from <strong>Liverpool</strong>, known for his
                        sharp delivery, 'one true scouser agenda, and low-key, atmospheric production style. He gained
                        attention in 2024 after the release of <strong>"Bally But It’s Just Daniel’s Hoodie"</strong>
                        featuring <strong>Rhys Ace</strong>, a track that circulated heavily online and introduced
                        listeners to his understated, deadpan flow.</p>

                    <p>He broke through more widely with <strong>"Luis Charles Sandals"</strong>
                        featuring <strong>Fakemark</strong> and <strong>Rhys Ace</strong>. Despite its joking title,
                        the track became a local favourite and marked the point where EsDanielKid shifted from niche
                        internet presence to a recognised voice in the UK underground scene.</p>

                    <p>His music is defined by a <strong>distinctly Scouse cadence</strong> paired with
                        cloud-rap-influenced beats — airy synths, sparse drum patterns, and a laid-back structure that
                        contrasts with his dry, clipped vocal delivery. Critics have noted that the combination gives
                        his music a unique blend of calmness and tension.</p>

                    <p>Although it is widely known that the artist behind the balaclava is <strong>Daniel
                            Cridland</strong>, he continues to perform and appear publicly in full face covering,
                        framing it less as anonymity and more as part of the project’s visual identity. He has been
                        consistent in avoiding personal details, rarely appearing in interviews and keeping his public
                        presence minimal.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Career</strong></p>
                    <p>EsDanielKid’s most successful single to date, <strong>"Luis Charles Sandals"</strong>, was released in February 2025, accumulating over <strong>20 million
                            Spotify streams</strong> by September of the same year. Its success helped cement his style
                        and expand his audience beyond Merseyside.</p>
                    <p>His debut mixtape, <strong>Rebel With No Receipts</strong>, released on <strong>20 June
                            2025</strong>, received positive reception for its cohesive production and consistent tone.
                        By November 2025, he had built a strong following on streaming platforms, with <strong>over 5.6
                            million monthly listeners</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In late 2025, TikTok users circulated rumours that EsDanielKid was actually <strong>Jayden
                            Thompson</strong> performing under an alias. The speculation was based on comparisons in
                        posture, clothing style, and vague mannerisms. The rumour faded after recordings surfaced
                        showing the two individuals in different locations on the same night, though the theory remains
                        a minor in-joke among some fans.</p>
